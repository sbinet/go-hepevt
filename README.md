go-hepevt
=========

Simple ``cgo`` bindings to the ``FORTRAN-77`` ``HEPEVT`` high energy event format library.

**Note** you'll need the simple ``HEPEVT`` package from:
  http://github.com/sbinet/f-hepevt which provides the simple ``COMMON
  BLOCK`` definition of ``HEPEVT`` as a shared library (``f-hepevt``).
